#COS 214
University of Pretoria module COS214 (Software modelling).

The module will introduce the concepts of model-driven analysis and design as a mechanism to develop and evaluate complex software systems. 
Systems will be decomposed into known entities, such as design patterns, classes, relationships, execution loops and process flow, in order to model the semantic aspects of the system in terms of structure and behaviour. 
An appropriate tool will be used to support the software modelling. The role of the software model in the enterprise will be highlighted. 
Students who successfully complete this module will be able to concep-tualise and analyse problems and abstract a solution.
